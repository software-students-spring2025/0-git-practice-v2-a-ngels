# How Data Science Could Reshape What We Know About the Law

<https://datascience.virginia.edu/news/how-data-science-could-reshape-what-we-know-about-law>

This article explores the relationship between data science and law by showing the work of Karolina Naranjo-Velasco and researchers at The University of Virginia. She highlights how data science tools such as natural language processing and large language models can be developed and trained to perform high-level summaries of legal documents. Additionally, she mentions the possibilities offered by new tools such as chatbots, which can help people become more informed regarding legal matters. At UVA, Li Zhang leads the Legal Data Lab, which is collaborating with the schoolâ€™s Supreme Court Litigation Clinic to predict the success of a petition being heard by the court. This project shows how data science applications can be used in the legal field by individuals.

What I found the most interesting is how these applications aren't just being used to help lawyers but the public as well. We see how data science is beginning to make its way into law, a field where work is usually done by humans.
